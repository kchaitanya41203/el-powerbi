The Power BI report built from the Sample Superstore dataset provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance across customers, regions, categories, and time. Key visuals include a Top 10 Customers bar chart, a filled map showing state-wise sales distribution, a line chart for monthly sales trends using a custom Month-Year field, and category-wise breakdowns using bar and pie charts. Filters and slicers are used to enable interactive analysis by segment, region, and date. Key insights reveal that a small group of customers contributes significantly to total sales, certain states like California lead in performance, and the Technology category often drives high revenue. The report highlights how discounts and segment differences impact profit margins, offering useful business insights for strategic decision-making.
